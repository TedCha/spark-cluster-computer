# raspberry-pi-4-spark-cluster
Project that details the creation of a Spark Cluster using Raspberry Pi 4 and Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04

## Introduction

## Physical Cluster Setup
#### 1. Pi/Server Rack

To start the setup, install your Raspberry Pis on the server rack casing. You can find these cases for cheap on Amazon.

#### 2. Network Connection

For my setup, I used a wired ethernet connection from my router which was then routed to my Netgear 4-port 100 Mbps Switch. Then, I connected each Raspberry Pi to the switch via a 1-foot ethernet cable.
